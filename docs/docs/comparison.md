| **SearchAutocompleteService** | ✅ Yes (3.0/3.5.0) | ✅ Yes (3.0) | ✅ Yes (3.0/3.5.0) | Package ID/version autocomplete |
| **RegistrationsBaseUrl** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Package metadata (catalog) |
| **PackageBaseAddress/3.0.0** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Package download (.nupkg) |

### Advanced Protocol Resources

| Resource Type | AvantiPoint Packages | Bagetter | NuGet.org | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **RegistrationsBaseUrl/3.4.0** | ✅ Yes (gzip SemVer1) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (gzip) | Compressed registration data |
| **RegistrationsBaseUrl/3.6.0** | ✅ Yes (gzip SemVer2) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (gzip) | Compressed with SemVer2 support |
| **RegistrationsBaseUrl/Versioned** | ✅ Yes (client 4.3.0+) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (client 4.3.0+) | Versioned compressed registrations |
| **ReadmeUriTemplate/6.13.0** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Package README files |
| **VulnerabilityInfo/6.7.0** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Known package vulnerabilities |
| **RepositorySignatures/5.0.0** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Repository signing certificates |

### NuGet.org Exclusive Resources

These resources are unique to NuGet.org and not typically needed for private feeds:

- **Catalog/3.0.0** - Full package event catalog (not needed for private feeds)
- **ReportAbuseUriTemplate** - Package abuse reporting (gallery-specific)
- **PackageDetailsUriTemplate** - Web gallery package page links
- **OwnerDetailsUriTemplate** - Package owner profile links
- **SearchGalleryQueryService** - Gallery-specific search
- **LegacyGallery/2.0.0** - v2 OData feed (legacy)

### Key Differences

**AvantiPoint Packages advantages:**
- ✅ **Vulnerability awareness** - Clients can discover known vulnerabilities (configurable)
- ✅ **Repository signatures** - Supports certificate-based package signing verification
- ✅ **README support** - Direct README.md file access via URI template
- ✅ **Gzip compression** - Efficient registration data transfer (3.4.0/3.6.0)
- ✅ **Advanced search** - SearchQueryService/3.5.0 with package type filtering
- ✅ **Client version targeting** - Versioned resources for optimal client compatibility
- ✅ **More NuGet features out of the box** - With roughly the same configuration effort as Bagetter, clients see richer protocol support (README, vulnerabilities, signing)

**Bagetter advantages:**
- ✅ **Straightforward core feed** - Focused on the essential v3 endpoints
- ✅ **Lightweight** - Fewer protocol features if you don't need READMEs, vulnerabilities, or signing
- ✅ **Wide compatibility** - Covers core v3 protocol requirements

**When protocol features matter:**
- **Use AvantiPoint Packages** when you want a private feed that stays closely aligned with NuGet.org’s latest protocol features (vulnerabilities, repository signing, READMEs, and more)
- **Use Bagetter** if you need a simple, reliable v3 feed without advanced features
- **Use NuGet.org** for public packages with gallery integration and abuse reporting

### What This Means for Package Consumers

#### Vulnerability Scanning

When NuGet tooling tries to use vulnerability information:

```pwsh
dotnet restore

# or
dotnet list package --vulnerable
```

- **AvantiPoint Packages / NuGet.org**:  
  - Vulnerability data is available when the client asks for it.  
  - No extra warnings – the vulnerability endpoint is present, so restore and build logs stay clean.
- **Bagetter**:  
  - The client cannot fetch vulnerability data from the feed.  
  - The NuGet client emits repeated warnings in restore/build logs because the vulnerability endpoint is missing.

#### Package READMEs

How READMEs show up in clients (Visual Studio, `dotnet` CLI, NuGet Package Explorer):

- **AvantiPoint Packages / NuGet.org**: READMEs are exposed via the API and can be rendered directly in tooling.
- **Bagetter**: READMEs are not exposed via the API; you must download and inspect the `.nupkg` to see them.

#### Repository Signing

Trust and tamper detection for packages:

- **AvantiPoint Packages / NuGet.org**: Clients can see that packages are signed by the repository owner, improving trust and helping detect tampering.
- **Bagetter**: No repository signing metadata is exposed, so clients cannot verify repository-level signatures.

#### Compressed Registrations

Impact on restore performance and bandwidth:

- **AvantiPoint Packages**: Uses gzip-compressed registrations, making metadata responses significantly smaller (faster restores, less bandwidth).
- **Bagetter**: Returns uncompressed JSON registration data, which increases payload size and network usage.

### Service Index Response Size

Real-world comparison of service index responses:

| Feed | Resources | Response Size | Notable Features |
|------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **NuGet.org** | 42 resources | ~8.5 KB | Full gallery, catalog, multiple regions |
| **AvantiPoint Packages** | 20 resources | ~2.1 KB | Vulnerability, signing, README, compression |
| **Bagetter** | 12 resources | ~1.2 KB | Core v3 protocol only |
